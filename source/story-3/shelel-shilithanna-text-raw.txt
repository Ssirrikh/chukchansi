A Rock To Be Jumped
Shelel’ Shilithanna



Not far from Bear Track Rock, there is another rock about five feet high.
’Oochiy’ noh’on dach’ahiy’ shelel’, ’amaa hid’an shelel’ nahni yitshinil dadach’ sipin

People amused themselves by jumping over it. 
Yokuch’ hik’iymaashim shilitmi sheleela

But when the people raced toward it, the rock would grow a trifle and scratch them as they went over it. 
Mi’in da’ yokooch’in lihimtaw ’amaa, ’ama shelel’ wil’ bohlow hapt’is xishwe’ ’amaamin shilittaw sheleela .  

Many men and women tried to clear it.
Galjin nonee’iy ’ama yo’ mokeela’ dameenata’ seleetich’ sheleela

Every time they tried to jump over it they got sore buttocks. 
Holoomun amoogin dameenataw shilta’ sheleela joote’ ’amaamin tekeetata’

It is still there, maybe they put a road there.
Hidma ’amaa, nahni ’aman xayaata’ peeli ’amaa.

That is all of that.
’Amaa ta’ach.’
