Shelel’ Shilithanaʔ
A Rock To Be Jumped



ʔooch’iy’ Nohʔoʔon Dach’aʔhiyaw Shelel’, ʔamaʔ hidʔan’ shelel’ nahniʔ yitshinil dadach’ sipin’.
Near Bear Track Rock, there is another rock about five feet high.

Yokuch’ hik’eymi ʔamaa taʔan shil’t’eʔ sheleela.
While playing, the people would jump the rock.

Miʔin daʔ yokuch’ wil’ lihmaʔiiwin’ ʔamaa.
The people would go run toward it. 

ʔamaʔ daʔ shelel’ wil’ bohloʔ hapt’is. 
Then the rock would grow a little. 

Miʔin shilittaw, xishweʔ ʔamaamin wil’.
When they jump over it, it would scratch them.

ʔaman noneeʔi ʔaman yoʔ mokeela wil’ demeenan’ shil’t’ayich’ daʔ sipin’.
The men and women would try to jump higher.

Holoomun ʔamoogun shilittaw sheleela, dik’in ʔamoogun wil’ texeetan’. 
Every time they try to jump over the rock, their behinds would hurt. 

Heddaʔ ʔamaa, nahniʔ ʔaman xayaataʔ peeli ʔamaa.
It is still there, maybe they put a road there.

ʔamaʔ taʔach’.
That is all of that.
