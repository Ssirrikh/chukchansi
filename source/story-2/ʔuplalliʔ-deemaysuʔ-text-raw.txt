Dove and Hummingbird Race with Each Other



Wooyiʔ Yokuch’ wil’ wileʔ, Deemay’suʔ mich ʔayax hoy’no.
Old time Indians would say, “Hummingbird was the fastest thing that flies.”

Hidʔan wil’ wileʔ, ʔuplalliʔ wakiy’ ʔayax Deemay’suʔun.
Others would say, “Dove was faster than Hummingbird.” 

Miʔin ʔaman baanelawshit ʔamaamig.
So they made them race each other. 

ʔuplalliʔ ʔamaʔ yoʔ Deemay’suʔ taanit baanewshich’ nootun’.
Dove and Hummingbird went racing up north. 

Juʔbaʔ yokuch’ taanit ʔamaa taʔashich’ wentaw.
Some people went there to watch at the start.

Juʔbaʔ hidʔan taanit taxoolow taʔashich’ hayk’itaw.
Some others went south to watch at the finish.

Dove and Hummingbird started flying right away. 

Hoy’li Deemay’suʔ deeyit waʔ; miʔin daʔ moyinmi goosiʔnat.
At first Hummingbird was far ahead, but eventually he tired and slowed up. 

Nahniʔ ʔayax, miʔin goosiʔnat. 
Sometimes he was fast, sometimes slow. 

ʔuplalliʔ wilch’init hoyinmeewet.
Dove just kept flying.

Hoy’li ʔam hoyonhiy’ wuk’yut sipin’ miʔin yoʔ ʔadil’.
At first his wings moved up and down. 

Miʔin daʔ gidwiyat ʔam hoyonhiy’.
Then his wings churned. (Narrator illustrates "paddle-wheel" motion with his arms.) 

Sanum ʔuplalliʔ walxot ʔam baanewsha. 
Soon Dove overtook his rival. 

Ch’awit ʔam.
He won. 

Deemay’suʔ daʔ waʔ dik’in.
And Hummingbird was far behind. 

Miʔin ʔaman hidyaʔ wilit, ʔuplalliʔ mich wakiy’ ʔayax hidyaʔan ch’enbayi.
Then everybody said, “Dove is faster than all the birds.”
